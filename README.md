This library is a Python implementation of the [OP-Stack SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io/). It tries to mirror some of the core functionalities such as:

- providing easy access to the OP-Stack contracts
- bridging of assets from L1 to L2 (deposits) and vice-versa (withdrawls)
- creating withdrawl proofs
